                    A blog exploring the implementation of pseudocode to combat difficult tasks and chronic procrastionation habits, as well as an outlining of my understanding of the Rubber Ducky Method.

                    Storytime: Pseudocode and Procrastination
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the previous sprint (Sprint 3), while working through the Javascript course on FreeCodeCamp, there were several occasions at the end of sections where an exercise was introduced that would unexpectedly significantly ramp up the difficulty. What had previous felt like smooth and comfortable progression then felt like suddenly running into a brick wall, and required intensive problem solving to eventually reach a solution. The problem solving technique I utilized in these instances was that of pseudocoding, as this was the most familiar to me. Through writing out the exercises into steps, outlining what each step should do in pseudocode, I was able to break down what had initially felt to be an overwhelming, large, and confusing task, into a few easy steps to follow and implement. In this way, I was able to smoothly get through these more difficult exercises despite the sudden jumps in difficulty; while they definitely took more time and thought, and quite some troubleshooting, they were not something I got stuck on for a long time because of these techniques employed.

                    At first, when I encountered these tasks, I immediately wanted to put them off for the next day, as I have a habit of chronic procrastination, so as soon as I come up against something difficult, or anything that requires some modicum of concentrated thought really, I immediately have a gut reaction to put it off for ‘future me’ to deal with, even while knowing that the future me will have no more inclination to do it than the current me. Like this, I have placed a lot of stress on myself in the past by putting things off until they physically cannot be stalled any longer, and thus squeezing them in at the last minute, with a lot of hypothetical hairs lost from the immense worry this generates. However, this time, I instead took a small break to clear my mind and trick the desire to procrastinate into temporarily being satisfied that I had avoided the difficult task, before coming at these exercises again, this time following the logical steps of the problem solving technique previously mentioned, pseudocoding. This allowed me to look at the task in smaller, manageable chunks rather than the large abstract task it initially appeared to be, and thus significantly decrease the perceived difficulty, meaning that as the desire to procrastinate increases or decreases based on difficulty, it was also reduced. I was then able to actually leisurely work through and complete the tasks this way, instead of stressing myself out and delaying them until the latest possible time to complete like I would normally do.

                    Problem Solving Techniques: The Rubber Ducky Method:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Rubber Ducky Method is a method of debugging code, or general problem solving, where an individual must formulate their question to an inanimate object, a rubber duck in the popular case, before asking it of anyone else. In this way, because the act of formulating the question, given that it is a coherent, competent, and well informed question, requires that the individual systematically works through the issue again themselves, and at the same time, looks at the issue from a different perspective, they are often able to come to the answer themselves through this perspective. It also helps if the individual posing the question is working through the code and observing what it does at the same time, as if they are doing this, any incongruencies between what they are saying and understanding it should do, and what it is actually doing, should become apparent, which wherein often lies the problem to be solved. This is an excellent problem solving skill that can be done both on one’s own, to try to work through something as much as possible without disrupting anyone else, but also can help in tandem with a colleague or senior who would then be posed the already well-formulated question in the event that the process of it’s formulation failed to bring about the desired solution.
