                <h2>
                    Personal Findings
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I have a degree in Psychology and am in a constant state of self exploration, both of which seemed to be the main fields the core content explored, so it is a bit difficult to identify three new things I learned, but it was a good refresher on many concepts so I will cover those here.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Firstly was the impact of negativity and pessimism, linking in closely to fixed vs growth mindsets. A constantly negative mindset as put me squarely into a fixed mindset that has prevented me from growing significantly over the last few years, and this was a good reminder of this for me - the differences between these mindsets is no new concept, but remembering their importance, and linking this in to my own experiences, has helped refresh me on the importance of not falling into the fixed category.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Second, and what I had already suspected to be the case, is something relating to neuroplasticity: as I have been working for the past few years, studying again for long periods of time has proved to be fairly difficult, which neuroplasticity would indicate is from not using those parts of my brain for a long period of time. This would make sense, as while work does require thinking, my job didn’t require anything in the technical side of things, so those skills have been difficult to pick up again. Again, neuroplasticity is something I learned about in my first year of psychology, but it is a good reminder to incorporate this knowledge into my day to day life; rather than just being aware of it, utilizing that knowledge to improve myself should be the goal.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Thirdly, highlighting the importance of Emotional Intelligence was good. I don’t particularly think my IQ is all that high, and my EI probably isn’t either, but I know I probably score around the average mark for both of these, so knowing that having a good sense of both and how this can supplement my productivity in the workplace is reassuring.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Surprises
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the more surprising things was that most of the core content focused on psychological principles. I had at first thought, and this was reinforced by the first week’s content, that this would more just be an exploration of emotions and morals, with no particular scientific backing, just stuff that seemed like it sounded good and meaningful. I was fairly impressed however that it then went into scientifically supported concepts like neuroplasticity and emotional intelligence though, these were a pleasant and welcome surprise, as it meant the core content of the first week’s sprint, which I didn’t particularly enjoy, was the exception rather than the norm.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The most challenging aspect of the core material for me was the first week’s sprint, which asked us to explore our personal identity and values, and share this exploration on our blogs. This felt very intrusive to me as I am not comfortable with sharing such personal parts of myself with total strangers, so it was definitely the most difficult part of the core material. Regardless, I did my best to share what I could and made a blog of it, even if this was incredibly uncomfortable, and thankfully, the rest of the core content has focused on external knowledge and skills to learn, so it has been much smooth from that first week on.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    The Reasons for Core
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I think the reason core is a big focus is because it helps cover some integral aspects of personal development that the technical side of things does not include. The best example of this is probably the week on neuroplasticity and the growth mindset, which cover how an individual can learn and develop, regardless of where they start from. I think this is very important for people to understand, as it can be very demoralizing and demotivating to start from a position behind others, and think that you can never catch up to them. This knowledge helps to counteract that, showing that everyone can learn and develop, and that there are no predetermined physical barriers preventing this. This could be the difference between some people thinking they are not good enough and dropping out, and them persevering until they are able to make it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    The Value of Core
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The time spent learning core was not wasted time, not so much because I learned new things, but more that this was a good refresher of things I already knew about, but had forgotten, or deliberately pushed to the background to justify my current lack of development. Again, taking this back to the example of the growth mindset explored in the previous section, I realized I had taken a more fixed mindset in my approach to many things, which is why I have explored a large variety of skills in the past few years, but never developed any of them past a very basic level of understanding, because of a fixed mindset seeing that I wasn’t particularly good at them, and thus justifying giving them up and moving onto something else that until I’ve explored it, I think I might be decent at it. Of course, this mindset made sure exactly the opposite of that happened, I didn’t get good at anything, because I would give up on them before any meaningful development could occur. Now, reminding myself of the growth mindset, I plan to take up some of those things again and persist at them a little more, knowing that through persistent effort, if I just keep doing it, I will eventually improve, and that the only barrier preventing improvement is how much effort I put in.
