                    A blog outlining the principles of Neuroplasticity and how the brain learns, develops, and operates with this system. The benefits of a Growth Mindset, compared to a Fixed Mindset, are also explored, as well as how both the principles of Neuroplasticity, and the benefits of maintaining a Growth Mindset, can be applied in my Learning Plan.

                <h2>
                    The Principles of Neuroplasticity and their Benefits
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Neuroplasticity is the ability for the brain to be malleable and adapt to different uses, and prolonged engagement with a particular use will prompt development in that area to make the brain more effective at engaging in that use case. For example, engaging with a specific task, say, calculation, will engage the neural networks involved in that kind of technical thinking, and thus, through prolonged engagement with similar tasks, those neural networks will stay active longer, and in turn, begin to develop and grow in order to make the brain able to more effectively complete such tasks. This highlights some of the biological changes behind the process of learning, that physical changes occur in the brain to adapt to learnt behaviour and thinking patterns, in order to make those actions easier in the future, as the brain has ‘learned’ them through its physical adaptations. Understanding these principles allows one to make the best use of them, as an underlying knowledge of how the brain learns will encourage an individual to adapt their learning strategies to accommodate this. This means that, rather than being demotivated by a lack of instant gratification from not learning something straight away, or relying on rote memory strategies to try and remember something, they can instead pursue learning strategies that deliberately target the brain's ability to grow through prolonged engagement, and as a result of this, benefit more when this pays off.

                    Utilizing the Principles of Neuroplasticity
                </h2>
                <p>
                    These principles can be engaged through the development of habits which aim to frequently and consistently engage the targeted neural networks through habitual attempts at challenges in these areas. For example, if one undertook the habit to code an hour a day, every day, with an additional goal to complete at least one challenging task within this hour of code, the individual would be engaging these neural networks regularly and frequently, and through prolonged pursuit of this habit, they would begin to develop and make the brain more effective at completing the tasks. This utilization actually goes hand in hand with habits and supports their effectiveness from a biological basis, as the pattern here is mimicked between the two: prolonged, regular engagements with an activity develops it into a habit, which in turn makes it easier to continue to do, a real world, behavioural reflection of the pattern of development neural networks follow.

                    Neuroplasticity Development
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Utilization of the principles of Neuroplasticity is the same as development of it, through engagement with learning strategies that utilize neuroplasticity, one is in turn developing their neuroplasticity. Some more specific strategies to develop neuroplasticity overall, and not just in the particular area a certain task may engage, are practicing holistic thinking, engagement with FLOW, pursuit of novelty and meditation. Practicing holistic thinking can help develop neuroplasticity as the brain is separated into two hemispheres, each of which predominantly governs certain types of thinking, and many people tend to fall in identifying with and mainly utilizing just one of these, rather than using both to their full potential. Holistic thinking, on the other hand, deliberately attempts to engage both hemispheres, and through this, thus develops global neuroplasticity throughout the brain. An example of how to practically do this would be to learn how to play an instrument, as the process of learning the cords and how to appropriately produce sounds engages the analytical hemisphere, while the creativity that comes with and is elicited from music engages the more creative hemisphere. Practicing FLOW also develops neuroplasticity, though in a more focused, concentrated area, rather than holistically. FLOW is the state of consciousness where one is fully immersed in the task at hand, so much so that time may seem to flow by without notice, and all outside distractions are forgotten. Flow also incorporates both hemispheres of the brain, and narrows them down to focus solely on the task at hand, giving a kind of ‘tunnel vision’, razor sharp focus on the current tasks, and thus, increased engagement with the neural networks involved. Finally, novelty can also help develop neuroplasticity, and this is required to mediated the suggestions of habits discussed earlier in this blog. Neuroplasticity involves restructuring the brain, which can often mean overwriting previous neural pathways with newer, more efficient ones for the task at hand. This means that habits, while they can be beneficial to the development of neuroplasticity if used wisely, can also be detrimental if one falls into a daily routine where they are comfortable and just on autopilot, and not consistently challenging themselves. If they are not, it becomes more difficult to overwrite old neural pathways with newer ones, and so the development of new skills can be incredibly difficult. As such, novelty should be consistently pursued, so that the brain does not become too entrenched in habits to the point where it no longer needs to be challenged on a day to day basis. This is, again, not to say that habits cannot be beneficial, it just highlights the importance of a habit of consistent challenge, rather than a habit of the completion of a task that does not necessarily stimulate the brain in any meaningful way.

                <h2>
                    The Growth Mindset and its Relevance
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Growth Mindset is the idea that through scientifically backed positive reinforcement of an individual’s innate potential to grow and learn, they are, in turn, able to develop more than if they were to retain a fixed mindset that their abilities and potential are static due to insurmountable predetermined biological differences. By opening awareness to the potential of the brain and demonstrating that scientific evidence points towards biological differences being malleable and thus able to be actively worked on and improved upon, positive reinforcement focusing on this potential is in turn supported to directly counteract fixed mindsets that can cause students to avoid learning and development because of preconceived notions that they will be unable to achieve due to rigid biological differences. This creates a highly effective approach to promoting student learning and the individual’s own innate potential, regardless of biological differences, and has given results that indicate a strong correlation towards increased development compared to regular reinforcement strategies.

                    Surprises and Changes in this Exploration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This exploration was not a surprise, as I have extensive experience in the field of Psychology, but it was a good reminder, as despite the prior clause, I have difficulty remembering many of the things I learned in this field until they are presented before me again. There was however, a realization in this exploration: that I frequently fall into a fixed mindset, which seems to have actively contributed to my avoidance of continued dedication to learning of certain subjects I have tried picking up in the last few years. Often, I fall into the pattern of becoming interesting in learning something, starting out at it, and being disappointed with the quality of my work in that field. From this, I become demotivated and often just give up further learning in that field, moving to another instead to eventually repeat the pattern. I have realized that this is most likely due to a fixed mindset operating in the background, that may be telling me that this is all I will ever amount to in that field, and so I should just give up and move to something I might be better in. Rather than looking at my progress as a ‘not there yet’, I just see it as a complete failure, and then run away from the learning process. Instead, I should attempt to deliberately engage with a growth mindset, and look at my progress as part of the learning process, and adapt the ‘not there yet’ perspective to any results that may turn out disappointing to me.

                <h2>
                    Integration of the Growth Mindset into the Learning Journey
                </h2>
                <p>
                    An awareness of the power of this mindset, and the power of the detrimental effects of the fixed mindset, is already an integration of the principles of both into my learning journey, as simple awareness highlights the importance of incorporating the former and avoiding entrapment from the latter. The growth mindset also highlights the importance of positive reinforcement, as this must be combined with the awareness of innate potential to be most effective, so I will be reminding myself of this throughout my learning journey and attempting to keep a positive, optimistic mindset, as this will help my growth the most. While it is very easy to slip into an overly pessimistic, negative mindset that is incredibly self-critical, I need to also remember that this will only be detrimental to my development, so should avoid this as much as possible to continue learning in the most effective way possible.
