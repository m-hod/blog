                    Long Term Goals
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I want to move into the career of programming, and so I am starting with web development. Ideally, I would like to be a self-employed contractor, or have flexible distance work, but these are end-goals. For now, I want to get a job from this programme and learn from senior colleagues and work my way up from there, until one day perhaps I will have the skills to be able to manage self-employment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Skills to Develop (Non-Technical)
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I’d like to make more friends, as my social circle is quite small, and I haven’t made many attempts to expand this since high school. With most of my friends living in different cities now, I would like to make some new meaningiful relations with new people and have friends in the same city I’m in.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Strengths and Limitations
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I think my strengths are that I am a logical thinker, and am good at breaking tasks down and completing them that way. 
                    I think my main weakness would be my attention span, years of content consumption on Youtube and Twitch has ruined my attention span and ability to focus for lengthy periods of time. I am slowly working on building this back up, but it is still something I struggle with. Self-discipline is another weakness that ties into this quite closely. I would like to develop healthy, productive habits to help with this, which I hope would then help me become more disciplined.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Workload Management & Commitment
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I will develop a schedule I will need to stick to religiously in order to develop the habits I need to succeed. It has been found that it takes about 2 months to develop new habits, so I will need to commit myself to this for at least that period of time. I will be trying to develop this prior to starting the in-person portion of the bootcamp, and will be continuing it for the entire period of it. If I can succeed in this, this would be an incredible feat for me and I believe would change my life around, as I have struggled with poor habits for years that have prevented me from meeting my goals, so if I can change these around they would have a significant positive impact on my life.

                <h2>
                    How to Seek Help
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I will seek help from staff when I need it, after attempting the problems myself to the best of my ability. If things are getting on top of me and I am beginning to panic, which I will know when, as it is a very familiar feeling to me, I will engage with staff to help sort through this.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Expectations
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I expect staff to be able to work through the issues with me and help me come to an appropriate plan for them. I know the issues will be ultimately up to me to solve, so I just hope that if I can’t figure this out myself, they will be able to help walk it through with me.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Scheduling Information
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I currently don’t have any commitments I would need to schedule around, and plan to keep these empty for the duration of the bootcamp. If there are times when I do not show up to class, they will be entirely up to laziness or poor habits, which I should be called out on immediately.

                    Long Term Goals
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This hasn’t changed, I still want to move into a career in programming, and think any junior role would be an enjoyable, solid job to start with. This is my primary goal right now and I’m not thinking about past this too much, but there are few options I am considering: either moving into self-employment contract work, or moving into the game development space.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Strengths and Limitations
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I still think my strengths and limitations are mostly the same, these aren’t something that will change over the course of 5 weeks. This period of time did however make me a little more confident in my strengths, as I didn’t struggle much at all, where I thought I would have in the later weeks. At the same time though however, it also reminded me that my limitations are significant and will take a long time with persistent effort to overcome, as I was unable to fall into the healthy habits I had wanted to begin cultivating during this time.

                    Biggest non-technical challenges
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since it is mentioned in the explanation material here in Sprint 5, I think my biggest challenge will be speaking in front of a group - this is not something I enjoy at all and have always struggled with, and seeing it suggested here is fairly demoralizing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Non-technical skills to develop
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I guess I would like to improve in-person communication skills, I know these suffer when I spend long periods of time in isolation like this 5 weeks have been so I expect them to be fairly poor again by the time bootcamp starts, so will need to work on getting used to this again.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Expectations
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Expectations are mostly the same, though with the introduction of peer programming and the mention of public speaking, I hope the team will be understanding of all personality types and accommodating to them by allowing some flexibility here.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Expectations for myself
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I expect myself to continue to hold an open mindset and to try everything with this mindset, rather than disregarding it beforehand and then going into it with a negative mindset which would just create a self-fulfilling prophecy. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I will manage my workload by dedicating the required amount of time each day, to show up to class with a good mindset, and to be open and receptive when working with others.
