                <h2>
                    The Relationship between HTML, CSS, and Javascript
                </h2>
                <p>
                    HTML, CSS, and additionally Javascript, can be analogous of the makeup of a human, splitting it into three core parts, the skeleton, the muscles, and the clothes that we adorn to make us unique. HTML takes the role of the bones here, laying the groundwork for which everything else is built upon. Without the bones, we would not be able to take the rigid shape that characterizes us as bipedal creatures, and would not have the base foundation upon which everything else, like the muscles and clothes, are built upon. In the same fashion, without HTML, websites would not be able to take the shape of websites, and thus this language serves as the base framework that creates the underlying website structure, upon which everything else is built on top of. Javascript takes the roles of the muscle here, giving functionality to the body. Without the muscles, the bones would be static, unable to move, and we would in no way have been able to develop into the most complex form of life to exist on this planet to date. In the same way, Javascript provides functionality to a website, allowing it to flourish and become a complex creation with a vastly diverse array of uses that HTML alone could never provide. Finally, CSS takes the role of clothes here, like the clothes a human adorns to give themselves a unique appearance over top of the muscles and bones, styling the HTML and Javascript. Without clothes, humans would have difficulty expressing their individuality that comes with their infinitely complex brains, and would look all too similar to other similar makeups of muscle and bone compatriots. In the same way, without CSS, websites made up of pure HTML and Javascript would all look like uniform plain-text. With clothes, humans are able to dress themselves up in all kinds of flamboyant fashion, distinguishing themselves from the crowd to express their uniqueness, and all the same, with CSS, websites are able to style themselves to look unique from the rest and develop their own personal style that will help them stand out and be recognizable in the mass of other websites across the net. As how all three of these elements are required to make up a unique human, all three of these are required to make up a unique website, and thus, they all exist in cooperation with each other, each relying on the other to build a complete whole.

                <h2>
                    Control Flow and Loops in Real Life
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Control flow and loops can be explained by examining the life of Salaryman Tanaka. Mr. Salaryman Tanaka must follow a strict schedule to meet the expectations of his workplace, and thus has developed habits he religiously follows every day. He wakes up in the morning, has a shower, has breakfast, brushes his teeth, then goes off to work, where he works all day, before coming home, picking up dinner from the convenience store on the way back, eating it when he gets home, then going to bed. Everything is in this strict order, with no deviation in between, and unfortunately for him, because he works in a black company, he does this every day of the week, and every week of the year. This is a real world demonstration of control flow and looping. Control flow dictates the flow in which lines of code execute, in sequential order down the page (given that they are in the same scope), which can be seen in Salaryman Tanaka’s rigid, sequential progression through his actions each day, doing each one in order, in the same order, every day. This in turn also demonstrates looping, Salaryman Tanaka does the same thing every day, with no deviation, and thus is looping like a loop in code would, executing the same lines of code, the same actions, with no deviation (unless specified with something like increments, for example) until the loop is finished. Like Salaryman Tanaka is doomed to proceed through the loop for the rest of his days as he fell prey to a black company, beware of infinite loops, as they will crash the code you are working on. Always make sure to implement a stopping point, so that you don’t end up like Salaryman Tanaka, lost in the misery of an infinite loop.

                <h2>
                    The DOM (Document Object Model)
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The DOM is the interface in which code interacts with the browser. It represents the browser page, the ‘document’, in ‘objects’ and nodes, thus making up the ‘Document Object’ Model. In this way, the browser page can then be interacted with through its representation, the DOM, via Javascript that modifies the values of the objects and nodes, and thus, the elements stored within them, allowing changes to the structure, style, and content of the webpage through this method. An example of this can be demonstrated through the use of a query selector, which ‘queries’ the identified elements of the DOM and selects them, allowing their modification. These can then be modified through the setting of new properties or attributes, which will thus change the values of those selected elements in the document. As a practical example to demonstrate this, if a document contains an h1 element with the class name class=”blue”, which has already been styled blue, querySelector(“.blue”) can then be employed to select the h1 element (and all other elements with the class “blue”). The innerHTML property can then be appended onto this selector to define new HTML content, which will replace the HTML content of the selected element. In this case, querySelector(“.blue”).innerHTML = “New Title” would select the h1 element and change its HTML content so that it now displayed “New Title” instead of whatever it’s old content may have been.

                <h2>
                    Arrays & Objects: Data Access
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Accessing data from arrays and objects has both similarities and differences. Both use some kind of notation, but the interactions between these are different for each. The first kind of notation, that which is shared between both arrays and objects, is bracket notation, which involves placing a selector in square brackets after calling the array or object (eg: array[selector] or object[selector]), and will then return the corresponding value of that selector in the object or array. In the case of arrays, this selector must be an index value, which will then return the item placed in the corresponding index in the array. For example, given an arrayName = [“cat”, “dog”, “mouse”], using bracket notation, we can get the return value of “dog” by using arrayName[1], as the item corresponding to the index value of ‘1’ is “dog” (remembering that index’s start from 0). Values from an object can be accessed in a similar way, however, since the key-value pairs in an object carry no inherent order, an index value cannot be used for this. Instead, a string containing the name of the key in the key-value pair in the object must be passed into the square brackets, which will then return the corresponding value for that key. For example, given an objectName = {“animal”: “cat”, “location”: “indoors”, “food”: “tuna”}, using bracket notation, we can get the return value of “indoors” using objectName[“location”], as the value corresponding to the key property called is “indoors”. In the same way, a new kind of notation, dot notation, can be used. This simplifies the syntax and makes it easier to read, using a dot followed by the key property, rather than square brackets. Using dot notation, the previous example can be refactored into objectName.location, returning the same value with much more simple and readable syntax. It is important to note that dot notation cannot be used with arrays, only bracket notation, as the index value must be passed in there. Also, when used with objects, dot notation is lacking one of the important functionalities of bracket notation allows: passing in key properties that are subject to change, or are not defined until an argument is passed in. This is important when a function contains an argument that is passed into a call for a return value from an object, which is incompatible with dot notation, but is allowed with bracket notation. The only changes here are that the value is not enclosed in quotation marks, as it is not a string, it is passing in the value of the corresponding argument (which should itself be a string). This allows for adaptive calls for a return value in the object based on the arguments passed into the function the call is contained within. Finally, another piece of data that may be accessed from an object is the name of the key property itself. As passing in the name of the property itself will return the value of that property, how does one return the name of the property itself in the case where this may be wanted? This is where the built in hasOwnProperty() method can be useful. While it does not return the value of the property name itself, the property name, contained within quotation marks, can be passed into the method, which will then check the object, returning a boolean value if the property is present (true) or not (false). This can be useful if the user needs similar functionality to what returning the name of the key property itself would be, but cannot otherwise directly do this.

                <h2>
                    Functions
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Functions are self-contained snippets of code that execute only when the function is called, and only within the scope of the function itself. They are extremely useful due to these two factors, they can be conditionally executed, so that all code in a document is not all run at once, which would break everything, and they can execute in isolation from other pieces of code that may interfere with their procedure. They can also return certain values outside of their scope, back into a higher function or into the main document, which can be handy for further purposes. Basically, functions are what make Javascript, and in turn, websites, ‘function’, as stupid as that is to say.
