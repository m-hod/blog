                        A blog exploring emotional intelligence, what it is, the various models that seek to map it, and comparisons to more traditional views of intelligence in the form of the intelligence quotient.

                    <h2>
                        What is Emotional Intelligence?
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        Emotional Intelligence is the ability to monitor both your own and other people’s emotions, to identify different emotions, discern between different emotions, and use that knowledge, both of your own and other’s emotions, to guide your thinking, behaviour, and decision making. The simplest form of this definition would be that emotional intelligence consists of four abilities: perceiving, using, understanding, and managing emotions. These abilities make up the basis of various models that have been developed to map Emotional Intelligence, the first and most prevalent of which is the Ability Model. This model holds a broad view of emotions as sources of information, that someone with a high emotional intelligence quotient is able to utilize to successfully navigate the social environment. Other models view emotional intelligence in more narrow, focused ways, like the Mixed Model, which focuses on it purely in the domain of leadership, that it consists of competencies that purely drive leadership skills and all the management of emotions that these entail, or the Trait Model, which sees it to be a skill based on self perceptions defined by aspects of one’s own personality traits, moving further away from emotions in their raw form and more into a holistic view of their interactions with the individual’s predetermined traits. Regardless, all three of these models recognize the importance of emotion management, in both the individual and those around them, and highlight the benefits of developing a high emotional intelligence quotient.

                    <h2>
                        Differences between Emotional Intelligence and the Intelligence Quotient
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        The Intelligence Quotient differentiates from the Emotional Intelligence Quotient by focusing more on technical skills, logical reasoning, word comprehension, mathematics, and abstract and spatial thinking, along with the ability to filter irrelevant, distracting information that may dilute attention away from the task at hand, as such mentally demanding tasks often require extended periods of highly focused attention to complete. Emotional Intelligence, on the other hand, focuses more on human skills, the ability to identify, evaluate, control, and express emotions, as well as perceiving and assessing others emotions, and using this emotional awareness to facilitate one’s thinking and understand emotional needs and meanings, of both the self and others.

                        As such, scoring highly on either of these skills indicates vastly different types of success, due to their fundamentally different focuses. Emotional Intelligence, due to its focus on a broad spectrum of interpersonal skills, has been found to predict success in teamwork, leadership, and personal relations, whereas the Intelligence Quotient, most likely due to it’s razor sharp focus on highly technical skills, predicts success in challenging technical tasks, analysis and connectivity, and research and development.

                    <h2>
                        Why is it important?
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        A good emotional intelligence quotient is beneficial to any workplace, as people are social creatures, and the ability to manage both oneselves emotions and those of others in the social environment will never prove useless. It is, in fact, a more rare occurrence that someone would need to work in isolation than working with others, and as such, it if often more desirable to have those of a higher emotional intelligence, than a higher intelligence quotient, if there were some circumstance where they were exclusive from each other, in order to better facilitate a healthy teamwork environment, and, as a result of such, prompt more fluid cooperation and thus, higher productivity.
