                Learning Plan
                <hr>
            </h1>
            <h2>
                Long Term Goals
            </h2>
            <p>
                I want to move into the career of programming, and so I am starting with web development. Ideally, I would like to be a self-employed contractor, or have flexible distance work, but these are end-goals. For now, I want to get a job from this programme and learn from senior colleagues and work my way up from there, until one day perhaps I will have the skills to be able to manage self-employment.
            </p>
            <h2>
                Skills to Develop (Non-Technical)
            </h2>
            <p>
                I’d like to make more friends, as my social circle is quite small, and I haven’t made many attempts to expand this since high school. With most of my friends living in different cities now, I would like to make some new meaningiful relations with new people and have friends in the same city I’m in.
            </p>
            <h2>
                Strengths and Limitations
            </h2>
            <p>
                I think my strengths are that I am a logical thinker, and am good at breaking tasks down and completing them that way. 
                I think my main weakness would be my attention span, years of content consumption on Youtube and Twitch has ruined my attention span and ability to focus for lengthy periods of time. I am slowly working on building this back up, but it is still something I struggle with. Self-discipline is another weakness that ties into this quite closely. I would like to develop healthy, productive habits to help with this, which I hope would then help me become more disciplined.
            </p>
            <h2>
                Workload Management & Commitment
            </h2>
            <p>
                I will develop a schedule I will need to stick to religiously in order to develop the habits I need to succeed. It has been found that it takes about 2 months to develop new habits, so I will need to commit myself to this for at least that period of time. I will be trying to develop this prior to starting the in-person portion of the bootcamp, and will be continuing it for the entire period of it. If I can succeed in this, this would be an incredible feat for me and I believe would change my life around, as I have struggled with poor habits for years that have prevented me from meeting my goals, so if I can change these around they would have a significant positive impact on my life.
            </p>
            <h2>
                How to Seek Help
            </h2>
            <p>
                I will seek help from staff when I need it, after attempting the problems myself to the best of my ability. If things are getting on top of me and I am beginning to panic, which I will know when, as it is a very familiar feeling to me, I will engage with staff to help sort through this.
            </p>
            <h2>
                Expectations
            </h2>
            <p>
                    I expect staff to be able to work through the issues with me and help me come to an appropriate plan for them. I know the issues will be ultimately up to me to solve, so I just hope that if I can’t figure this out myself, they will be able to help walk it through with me.
            </p>
            <h2>
                Scheduling Information
            </h2>
            <p>
                    I currently don’t have any commitments I would need to schedule around, and plan to keep these empty for the duration of the bootcamp. If there are times when I do not show up to class, they will be entirely up to laziness or poor habits, which I should be called out on immediately.
